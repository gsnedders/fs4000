                        FSHOST.EXE

  GUI program to drive FS4000US scanner.  Can display thumbnail and save
  scan images to TIFF files.  Features auto-exposure (optional), positive /
  negative modes, and auto-repeat option.  Auto-repeat ejects holder after
  scans done and starts scanning (selected frames) automatically when
  holder inserted.

  Does not support cropping or FARE.

  Requires ASPI (4.6 or 4.7x); tested with W98SE, NT4, NT5.

  FsHost.exe should be run by clicking on the file in Explorer or by creating
  a shortcut to this exe file.  The shortcut should set the working directory
  as required (generally the directory containing the exe file).  This working
  directory is where all work and scan files are created.

                        Tune function

  This loads variables to improve scan quality.  If negative mode is selected
  the function also compensates for the film base colour by scanning the area
  between frames 1 and 2.

  The scanner takes a while (perhaps 30 minutes) to stabilise so 'tune's done
  during this period may be correct for a short time only.


                        Thumbnail window

  Can scroll using keyboard or mouse.  Can scroll via dragging.  The thumbnail
  exposure is specified by the exposure setting (1x - 12x).  Changing the
  exposure after the thumbnail changes the display image to show the result of
  a scan at the particular setting.

  After a thumbnail scan, keyboard focus is set to the scroll bar.  Most of
  the navigation keys affect the scroll position but the up and down arrow
  keys affect the exposure slider.


                        Scans

  Without auto-exposure each scan is a single pass operation using the
  currently selected exposure.

  With auto-exposure a forward pre-pass is done and then a reverse scan pass.
  The selected exposure is not displayed but is recorded in the log file.


                        Exposure

  Controls exposure time (and scan speed).  The default setting is 2 and the
  range is from 1 to 12.  This affects thumbnails (always) and scans (when
  auto-exposure not selected).


                        Bugs

  The arrow keys are meant to adjust the exposure and scroll sliders only but
  this does not work when a button has focus.  It seems that these keys bypass
  the preview filter established by the form.
