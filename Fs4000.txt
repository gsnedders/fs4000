                        FS4000.EXE

  Program to drive FS4000US scanner and to produce quality scans of my
  Kodachrome slides.  The scan code overlaps the reading and processing
  of the data for smooth operation and reduced time per frame.

  Requires ASPI (4.6 or 4.7x); tested with W98SE, NT4, NT5.


        Syntax:         Fs4000.exe  keywords

  Keywords are either commands or modifiers.  Modifiers affect following
  commands.  Commands effect actions.  Text is not case-sensitive.

  G+nnn   = boost green exposure nnn % (e.g. +50 = 50% boost)
  B+nnn   = boost blue  exposure nnn % (e.g. +50 = 50% boost)
  export  = use external program (FsTiff.exe) to build TIFF files
  in8     = force 8-bit input mode (stupid)

        Notes:

- For smooth operation Fs4000 needs about 140MB of actual RAM.
- To eject holder: open (slightly) and close front door


        Files:

FsHost.exe      - scanner program (GUI)
Fs4000.exe      - scanner program (console)
Fs4000.dll      - dll so user program can drive scanner
Fs4000imp.def   - def from Fs4000.dll
Fs4000imp.lib   - library of Fs4000.dll exports
libtiff.dll     - reqd by Fs4000.*
libtiffimp.lib  - library of libtiff.dll exports
FsTiff.exe      - program to build TIFF files from raw files


        For user program to use Fs4000.dll:

- include Fs4000.h
- link Fs4000imp.lib
- At BOJ,
    use FS4_GetHandles and FS4_SetHandles to get console output, etc
    call FS4_BOJ () and check result is 0
- Call FS4_ProcessWord (arg) for each command word
    and / or
  Call FS4_Process (argc, argv []) to process array of words
    and / or
  Call FS4_xxxxxxx (...) directly to tune, scan, etc
- Can call FS4_SetAbort (via another thread) to kill task in progress


        Trivia

- moving holder to 0 using abs or rel move causes fs4000 to eject holder.
Must use home command instead.

- carriage relative positioning is rejected when carriage is homed.

- SetFrame 10 should stop carriage movement during scan but still get
movement is carriage is homed.  Okay if not homed.

- SetWindow SCSI_WINDOW_DESCRIPTOR.reserved[12] must be x02, x12, x22, or x32.
Can't see the effect of this.

Film holders contain white and black areas.  White areas are where each pixel
sees the lamp.  Black areas are where the lamp is covered.  However, the black
area in the negative holder is quite narrow and the readings are affected by
light from the edges.

The default scanning speed is 2.  Speed 1 can be used and is faster but the
noise is higher.  Speed 3 is significantly slower than 2 and the noise is
slightly lower.  Speeds slower than 3 do not reduce the noise.

                Load gamma array for 16-bit to 8-bit conversion

        To reduce the effects of noise in low-level samples, the
        slope can be limited by specifying the min value that is
        not slope limited.  For a Dmax of 3.0 this value would be
        65536 / (10 ^ 3) for instance.

        When loading the table the code finds the first step
        after this minimum value, gets the previous step width,
        and then creates steps of this width back to the start of
        the table.  When the distance back to the start is not a
        multiple of the step width we shift the entries to fix
        this.  This shift is the XOffset.  Also, we have Y
        offsets (YOldBase and YNewBase) to compensate for the
        change in number of steps to this point.  This gets the
        values at the low end of the table correct.  Finally, we
        have a Y multiplication factor (dYMult) to negate the
        effect of the Y shift at the high end of the table.

                Calc gains and offsets

        'Fs4000.exe tune dump'

ScanModeData.unknown3 [3] = {60, 60, 60};       // 0 - 63       analogue gain
ScanModeData.unknown4 [3] = {280, 280, 280};    // 0 - 511      analogue offset
ScanModeData.unknown5 [3] = {750, 750, 750};    // 0 - 1000     shutter time

The CCD samples are based on the light and the shutter time.

The CCD samples are adjusted by :-
a) an offset (unk4, 0 - 255 = add 0 - 255, 256 - 511 = sub 0 - 255)
b) programmable gain (unk3, 0 - 63 = 1 - 5.8 gain)

Analogue gain (unknown3)
- gain = 5.8 / (1.0 + (4.8 * ((63 - unknown3) / 63)))
- entry = (3654 * (gain - 1)) / (48 * gain)

Analogue offset (unknown4)
- 9-bit entry (sign + 8-bit adjust)
- if sign = 0, input += adjust
- if sign = 1, input -= adjust
- 16-bit effect = (adjust * 19) approx when analogue gain = 1

Shutter time (unknown5)
- Entry (0 - 1000) specifies shutter open portion of exposure period.


        Order of operations.

a) Wait for stable lamp.

b) Set shutters for white balance.  This affects the offsets so must be
   done first.

c) Set black level analogue offsets.

d) Set white level analogue gains.

e) Set black level digital offset for each sample.

f) Set white level digital gain for each sample.

                Thumbnail scan with TIF output

        'Fs4000.exe tune out8 thumb'

        The normal approach here is to scan in 14-bit mode with
        output set to 8-bit gamma compensated.

--------------------------------------------------------------*/

/*--------------------------------------------------------------

                Scan a frame

        'Fs4000.exe tune out8 ae scan 1'

For best scan quality :-
a) Gamma table is now linear from 0 to 32 (0 to 8 in 8-bit output).
b) 14-bit input is now converted to 16-bit in read stage.
c) Setting reads to 16-bit (rather than 14) reduces chance of gappy histogram.
d) General boost now reduces scan speed to achieve effect as far as possible
   and then adjusts multipliers to achieve final effect.
e) Individual boost (R or G or B) uses multiplier to achieve effect.

We use gamma 2.2 for 8-bit output as it is *the* standard.  Gamma 1.5 would be
better given the realistic Dmax (about 3) of the scanner.

It is better to achieve exposure and colour balance by specifying boosts here
rather than adjusting the scan file in Photoshop, etc.

The holder offsets listed below for each frame are all 36 more than the
offset of the frame in a thumbnail view.  This is probably because the
carriage advances a bit (past the home sensor) before the scan data
collection starts.

        Position holder (absolute and relative)

unknown1        0 = carraige, 1 = holder
unknown2        0 = home
                1 = eject (only for holder)
                2 = rel position (+offset)
                3 = rel position (-offset)
                4 = abs position (=offset)

Carraige position is in 8000dpi increments.
Holder position is in 360dpi increments.
Reverse relative pos to pos < 50 causes fs4000 to eject holder.
- fs4000 freaks if home sensed during positioning.
Warning :- if carraige not homed before holder homed, holder hits case.

               2 = scan rightmost line (width times)
               3 = scan leftmost  line (width times)
               4 = scan current   line (width times)
        2 & 3 position carriage before scan but don't move during scan,
        4 doesn't move carriage at all.
